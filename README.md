My project for developing a smart street light
system. In this project, the street light system, in which lights on
when needed and light-off when not needed.
Currently, in the whole world, enormous electric energy is
consumed by the street lamps, which are automatically turn
on when vehicles and pedestrians pass the street in dark and
automatically turn off when they cross over the street. This is
the huge waste of energy in the whole world and should be
changed.
My smart street light system consists of a LED light, a motion
sensor and a short-distance communication network. The lights
turn on before pedestrians and vehicles come and turn off or
reduce power when there is no one. It will be difficult for
pedestrians and drivers of vehicles to distinguish our smart street
lamps and the conventional street lights, since our street lamps
all turn on before they come.
The present status and the future prospects of my smart start
light project will be considered.
